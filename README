TomBoy is a "needs-based" AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) application for the iPhone.

It's generally designed for non-verbal folks, but anyone that can find a use for it is welcome to do so.

There are some screenshots over on the wiki: http://wiki.github.com/koudelka/TomBoy

This is the initial release of TomBoy, there are more planned features, but I don't know when I'll be able to get to them, any contributions to the codebase are encouraged. :)
